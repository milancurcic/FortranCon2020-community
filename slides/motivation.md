### Problem and Motivation

Fortran is a powerful, easy-to-learn language, and

1. It lacks modern tooling
2. Has a poor ecosystem of libraries
3. Its users are scattered and disconnected

➡ **User adoption and new Fortran projects are diminishing**
</section>


<section>

### Fortran lacks modern tooling

* No comprehensive standard library
* No go-to build system
* No package management solution
* Open source compilers few and far between

➡ **Great language that can be difficult to work with**
</section>


<section>

### Poor library ecosystem

* Fortran started in the pre-internet era
* Before email, websites, or version control
* GitHub? Forget about it!
* Scarce open source library ecosystem

➡ **Many wheels re-invented but not shared**
</section>


<section>

### Fortran users are scattered and disconnected

* Difficult to find other users
* No central online presence
* Conferences and meetups few and far between
  
➡ **Difficult to stay motivated and makes you re-invent the wheel**
</section>


<section>

### Fortran also has a PR problem

* Most of society still only knows of FORTRAN
* Mainframes, punchcards, and UPPERCASE
* Images deeply engraved into the cultural DNA
* Fortran is not the village idiot of programming languages,
yet, it is being treated as such

➡ **This is bad. We need to change it.**

### Our desires for Fortran

* Fortran should be easy and fun to work with
* It should feel like play and not work
* Rich ecosystem of open source libraries
* Run Fortran code on any architecture: CPUs, GPUs, emerging platforms
</section>


<section>

### How do we get there?

We need:

* A rich standard library
* An easy-to-use, fast package manager
* A cutting-edge open source compiler and interpreter 
* A modern, beautiful website and learning resources to attract new users
* A welcoming and inclusive online community
