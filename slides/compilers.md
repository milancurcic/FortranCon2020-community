### Compilers

* gfortran currently the only mature open source compiler
* Lack of a Fortran interpreter makes rapid prototyping
difficult
* Flang and LFortran under development (both LLVM based) 
* Lacking support for GPUs and other emerging platforms
</section>


<section>

### Long-term goals

* Community developed open source compiler and interpreter
* Native and seamless support for CPUs, GPUs, and other emerging platforms
* Cross-platform for major OS's
