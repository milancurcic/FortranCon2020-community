**Title**: Toward a thriving open source Fortran community

**Abstract**:
A thriving community around a programming language is essential for onboarding
new users and retaining existing ones.
Besides a few discussion boards and mailing lists, Fortran has not had a
healthy online community in the modern internet era, like many other
programming languages have.
Despite the development of the language, its user base has been
declining as a result.
Many new software projects are being started in languages like C++, Python,
or Julia, despite Fortran being better suited for the task at hand.
In this talk, we will discuss the need for and the ongoing development of the new
fortran-lang (https://fortran-lang.org) community and its suite of projects
that currently include a standard library, package manager, and a website.
Fortran-lang aims to provide a central place for Fortran users, beginning and
expert alike, to find recommended tools, libraries, tutorials, and
discussion venues that are inclusive and welcoming of newcomers.
We believe that an organized community and a home of Fortran on the internet,
in addition to the Standards Committee and compiler developers,
are essential for the long-term thriving—and not just mere survival—of Fortran.
Finally, we will discuss the next steps, the one-year vision, and the 10-year
vision for going forward.
